"description":"NurseAI – Essential Nursing Tools in One App\n\n\nNurseAI is built for nurses, clinical staff, and community health workers who need quick, reliable answers during their workflow. In this first release, we’ve focused on the three features that make the most difference at the bedside and in the community.\n\n\n1. Drug Reference Guide\n\n\nSearch by generic or brand name to access trusted information on drug indications, standard dosing, contraindications, side effects, and nursing considerations.\n\n\n• Data Sources: FDA Open Data (Drug Labeling API) and RxNorm API.\n• Key Benefit: Instant, evidence-based medication lookups without flipping through manuals.\n• Offline Capability: Core drug data stored locally for faster, reliable access.\n\n2. SDOH Screening & Local Resource Finder\n\n\nIdentify patient needs beyond the clinic using a structured Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) questionnaire covering housing, food, transportation, safety, and more. NurseAI then recommends local resources based on the user’s ZIP code.\n\n\n•Screening Tool: CMS Accountable Health Communities (AHC) format.\n•Local Resource Finder: Integrated with findhelp.org and other directories.\n•Goal: Address non-medical barriers to health by connecting patients to real community support\n\n\nWhy Choose NurseAI?\n\n• Focused on workflow speed and accuracy.\n• Built on trusted data sources (FDA, RxNorm, CMS, findhelp.org).\n• Designed with a HIPAA-conscious architecture—local storage for PHI-sensitive tools.\n• Simple, clean interface with smart search functionality.\u2028\n\n\nComing Soon\nFuture updates will expand NurseAI’s capabilities, including features such as securely sending screening results to Dr. Health Agent for coordinated care.", "contentAdvisoryRating":"17+", "averageUserRating":0, "minimumOsVersion":"17.0", "releaseDate":"2025-08-19T07:00:00Z", "userRatingCount":0},
